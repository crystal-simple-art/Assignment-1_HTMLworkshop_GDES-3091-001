<!--Q&A section -->
<h2><a href="https://victo-ngai.com/of-qa" target="_blank">Q&A</a></h2>

  <h3>CAREER CHOICE</h3>
    <h4> When did you first start drawing and creating artwork. </h4>
    <p> I first started drawing when I was really young , though I'm not sure those drawings can be counted as artwork. My parents were really busy and I had pretty lonely childhood being an only child, so I began drawing to keep myself company an to stay amused while I was on my own. </p>

<div class="spacing">
    <h4> What is the exact moment you decided to become an illustrators artist?</h4>
    <p> I have always loved to tell stories and communicate ideas with drawings since I was a kid, but have not heard of the term “illustration” until RISD. I entered the school with much passion about art but the vaguest idea of what I will do upon graduation. During freshmen year, I actually first declared major in graphic design, but when I happened on a presentation by the illustration department, I thought to myself, that’s what I want to do. </p>
</div>

<div class="spacing">
    <h4> How did you get started in the art world?</h4>
    <p> A classmate commissioned me to do a comic stripe and paid me generously in candies in third grade.
If we are talking about professional commissions, I first got hired when I was a junior at RISD, SooJin Buzelli, a well regarded creative director and conveniently wife of my professor Chris Buzelli, saw my class work and decide to print it in her magazine. This strike of good luck resulted in a wonderful working relationship of 9 years and counting, as well as a portfolio with some published work by the time I graduated. SooJin has also graciously introduced me to Irene Gallo, creative director and publisher at Tor.com, and that's how I started branching out into the SFF industry.
Upon graduation, I took my portfolio to AD Aviva Michaelov at the New York Times, she became my second client. After working with the Times for a couple years, Aviva recommended me to AD Jordan Awan at the New Yorker, this landed me an interview and the opportunity to work with this prestigious magazine.
Through working with high-profile publications, building an online following and winning competitions, I gradually built up a name and started attracting other editorial as well as book and advertising clients.</p>
</div>

<div class="spacing">
    <h4>What do you like most about being a freelance illustrator?</h4>
    <p>Getting paid to do what I love. Also the freedom of working from anywhere and at anytime.</p>
</div>

<div class="spacing">
    <h4>Is freelancing for everyone?</h4>
    <p>No. Freelance illustration is more than a job – it’s a lifestyle.
Being a freelancer is very much like being an entire company, at least in the beginning, there are many hats to wear: CEO, Artist, Marketing person, Accounting, PR and Janitor. That means the day to day is not always sugar and spice and everything fun, some days I have to spend more time answering emails and reading through contracts then drawing.
The freelance lifestyle also demand a lot of self-discipline, in both work and play/rest. It's been challenging for me to separate work and personal life, especially without official clock in and clock out, weekends and holidays. Sometimes I have no choice but to let my social life take a back seat, cancel plans with friends due to rush deadlines or revisions.
The hardest thing about freelancing is probably the toll on one's self-image and emotional well being, especially after one is cooped up alone in the studio for days, and sleep deprived. Freelancers attach their names to their work, which are extension of the artists' taste, experience and preferences, so it's very difficult to not take things personally when the project is not going well or when the work is being rejected. It's not uncommon to feel both moments of grandeur as well as doubts and depression during one single project. Therefore making an effort to socialize and be part of a supporting community is very important. I found sharing a studio with other people has helped a lot. </p>
</div>

<div class="spacing">
    <h4>How did you stay and work in the US being an international alien?</h4>
    <p>I was able to obtain the O-1 artist VISA during my one year OPT. I hired a VISA broker to help me better present the evidences and strengthen my case. It costed quite a bit ($5-7K in 2010) but I would recommend the professional help if you can save up that amount, as the process is quite complicated. Besides all that jazz such as supporting evidences and recommendation letters (see the details on US citizenship & immigrantion website), you would also need a sponsor - someone who contracts you work in the States. In my case, It's my agent.  </p>

  <h3>ON BEING AN ILLUSTRATOR</h3>
    <h4> In your opinion, whats the difference between an artist and an illustration? are you planing to be a professional artist. </h4>
    <p> Being a professional illustrator IS being a professional artist. Artist is an umbrella term which includes sub-catergories, illustration being one of them.
If the question is about the difference between illustrators vs gallery/fine artists, then the most obvious answer would be the way we make our money. Most illustrators are commissioned by clients to create the work while most gallery artists create their body of work then sell them to their clients. In my opinion, the titles of "illustrator" and  "fine artist"  are just hats people wear, a person can easily be both and many other things. Also often the line between the two is not so clear, if we define artists who are commissioned to create images as illustrators, then Michelangelo and Da Vinci are both illustrators. If we define artists whose work are shown in museums and galleries as fine artists, then the above mentioned masters are also fine artist. </p>

<div class="spacing">
  <h4>What is the biggest lesson you have learned about being an illustrator?</h4>
  <p>The biggest and hardest lesson to learn about myself is that - no matter how hard I try, I can’t knock every piece out of the ball part. I looked up Joe DiMaggio’s slugging percentage and it’s somewhere around 0.5-0.6, which made me feel better. .
It used to be a lot easier for me to experiment when I was starting out, as there's nothing to lose. But now, with external and internal expectations, I have to keep remembering Joe DiMaggio, stay positive and move on from the less successful pieces. Anyimprovement curve is like jumping, sometimes it's necessary to go back to go further. </p>
</div>

<div class="spacing">
  <h4>Do you ever find yourself obsessed with the subject of an article after doing an illustration for it?</h4>
  <p>Certainly. One of the nice things about being an editorial illustrator is that we are "forced" to read things we normally wouldn't pick up. I hated finance and economy when I was in high-school, mostly to rebel against my father, who worked in the industry. Emo teenager Victo thought money was filthy and went into art school. Ironically most of my early clients were trade/business magazines. After reading many articles and doing research for the projects, I grew more and more interested in the subject matter. Now I read economic-related books written by authors such as David Harvey for leisure, love the NPR Money Planet and Freaknomics program, and my friends would tell you I am huge geek in credit scores and NY real estate.</p>
</div>

<br>

  <h3>ON FUTURE/ FUTURE OF ILLUSTRATION</h3>
    <h4>What’s something that you’d love to do but haven’t done yet?</h4>
    <p>I would absolutely love to author my own book or short animation. I have wanted to make this happen in a while now but haven't grasped a concrete idea/story yet. Since it would be a long-term project that I would really need to dedicate my time to work on – therefore I need to be truly passionate about it. I’m constantly learning and, I guess, “growing” each day, so I know one day – hopefully in the near future – I will make it happen.</p>

<div class="spacing">
    <h4>What are your plans for the future? What are your hopes and dreams for the future?</h4>
    <p>I hope I will always wanted to draw, and keep making better work.</p>
</div>

<div class="spacing">
    <h4>What do you think is the future of illustration?</h4>
    <p>From cave paintings, to fresco, to tapestries to tablets, the media may change but I think illustration will always be around.</p>
</div>

<br>


  <h3>INSPIRATION/COMING UP WITH IDEAS</h3>
    <h4>What inspires your artistic vision and where does your illustration ideas come from?  </h4>
    <p>“Inspiration” can come from everything and anything - the environment, people on the subway, music, books and of course other artists’ work and much more. I think inspiration is kind of unpredictable, but if one is willing and open to be inspired, one will get the most extraordinary ideas out of seemingly ordinary things.
When “inspiration” is talked about, many have the mental image of a light bulb miraculously lighting up on top of someone’s head. But what’s not being shown here is all the time and effort that led to this eureka moment. I like to imagine inspiration as a clothes closet, when a special occasion arises, it’s much easier to find the right outfit if one already has a diverse and comprehensive collection, versus having to hunt down new clothes at the very last minute. To enrich the inspiration closet, I think it’s important to approach the world with a curator’s eyes: be eager and open-mind with new knowledge and experience, yet purposeful and selective with those we file away into our collection. After all, it's  impossible to create from nothing, I see the process of art-making as digesting the world through an artistic lens. </p>


<div class="spacing">
    <h4>Can you give us an example of how you come up with a concept for an editorial illustration to accompany an article?</h4>
    <p>I hope I will always wanted to draw, and keep making better work.</p>
</div>

<div class="spacing">
    <h4>Can you give us an example of how you come up with a concept for an editorial illustration to accompany an article?</h4>
    <p>When I am looking for inspiration for a particular commissioned project, I start with distilling what need to be communicated through the illustration, what is the the core message here? Sometimes certain words from the articles or the client's art direction would stand out to me, I would then brainstorm and see if I can elaborate on these hunches, rumbling in the inspiration close and see if I can find the most fitting yet surprising combinations of symbolisms/metaphors to tell this story. After that, I would start making thumbnails to visualize the concepts, sometimes if I am lucky, my own scribbling would serve as another enzyme which stirs up new and better ideas. Seldom the first ideas are the final one being used, so it's a good idea not to settle for the first thing but to keep pushing the brain and see what else is possible.</p>
